# Manolin Fish Disease Library

This repository contains the source information for the [Fish Disease Library](https://fishdiseases.manolinaqua.com/), and the corresponding documentation to contribute information back into the library for future readers.

## Contribute

To contribute to the Manolin Fish Disease Library:

1. Fork the [fish-disease-library](https://github.com/manolinaqua/fish-disease-library) repository.
2. In the Obsidian vault switcher, select **Open folder as vault**.
3. Select the subfolder for the translation you want to contribute to, for example `/en/`. Don't open the root folder as a vault, as this may lead to links being updated incorrectly.

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Fix typos and mistakes**: If you want to fix a typo or other small modifications, you can submit a pull request. For smaller edits, you can use the GitHub web interface instead of cloning the repository.
- **Add missing or outdated content**: If you want to contribute missing or outdated content, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/manolinaqua/fish-disease-library/issues) before you start working on it.

Any contributions to the English docs must follow Obsidian's [Style guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Contributing+to+Obsidian/Style+guide).
